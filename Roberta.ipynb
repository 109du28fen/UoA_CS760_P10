to other topoftheline brands but always returned to hoover for their unsurpassed cleaning power and reliabilitythat does not however mean they were perfectthe hoover windtunnel u6439 bagged upright that ie had for the last several years would suck up a buick unfortunately it also rivaled a buick in the weight category although it supposedly a elfpropelledmodel i felt like i had to go into training in order to vacuum my house it became something i would put off because i wasn sure i had the strength to wrestle this bulky beast all over my housethe windtunnel controls which allow you to change the brush height from carpet to floor were manual hardtomove levers on the brush housing which required you to shut the machine off in order to properly manipulate themthe hepa filter on my old windtunnel seemed to work only for the first few months after that all manner of airborne particles would fly around as i vacuumed even after i cleanedreplaced the filterslastly noise of my previous windtunnel was something akin to a jet taking offwhen i saw a tv commercial for the hoover platinum series machines i was definitely intrigued i loved the idea of getting two separate vacuums together for one price brilliant marketing idea there hoover but i was skeptical could the power of a hoover truly be housed in something that weighs only 11 pounds i tried other lightweight vacuums in the past and their suction was dubious at besti made a beeline for the internet to start researching over a couple of days of intensive reading i decided to continue my trust in hoover and took the plungeboth machines come packaged together in a single tall box which was waiting for me on my front porch when i got home from work the first thing i noticed was that i could actually lift the entire box into the house without grunting like a sumo wrestlerthat was promising after removing everything i was stunned at the weight or lack thereof for both machinesthe physical appearance is very appealing the upright is sleek and slim with a 35long cord and the canister has toolsonboard along with an ingenious shoulder strap so you can ear itwhile you vacuum you will be stunned by how little these machines weigh a child could easily lift them both but could they cleanwhen i fired up the platinum upright the word that kept coming out of my mouth was wow first off no more jets taking off in my living room just a pleasing hum second this impossibly lightweight wonder gives a whole new meaning to the term selfpropelled it seemingly floated over my carpeting all on its own while still having the suckupabuick power i expected from a hoover it cleaned better in one pass than its older u6439 windtunnel behemoth cousin did in several passes i was picking up stuff i didn even know was there whether vacuuming underneath your bed or behind that dresser that you haven moved since you moved in 15 years ago it was astonishing how well this machine worked in just one passi have a rather large bulky throw rug in my kitchen that i had been preparing to replace because it had become so unvacuumable in recent weeks the platinum upright made it look brand new and hallelujah for a true edge cleaner everyone claims to have edge cleaning ability on their uprights but this one truly delivers on the promise think about those sneaky areas in your house where all sorts of stuff lingers like that dead zone along the baseboards tucked up under the bottom of your kitchen cabinets where they meet the kitchen floor this platinum upright sucked up all that debris right to the edgethe maneuverability of the platinum upright is astonishing it truly is as light as hoover claims and it moves as easily as a dyson the upright portion of the machine lowers completely parallel to the floor so it really can move under coffee tables with ease it also moves from carpeting to floors effortlessly with an intelligent lighted fingertip control right up there on the handlethe hepa filtration is lightyears ahead of my previous windtunnel think hepa with a hemi under the hood yes i know that bags are expensive but you can find discounts if you search online and buy in bulk i don mind paying for a product that truly works these bags and this new platinum hepa filtration system truly work no dust or other airborne nasties were visible anywherethe platinum canister has a carrying strap which makes so much sense the folks who clean my office building uses strapon canister vacuums and i always hat an intelligent designnow ie got my own and all the tools are right there attached to the unit ready and waiting for you i toted that canister all over the house cleaning window sills ceiling corners air conditioning vents everything then i walked into the garage and cleaned the inside of my suv it quiet powerful and incredibly portable the best anisterie ever usedin my first test run of this hoover platinum acuum systemi found myself looking for stuff to clean i couldn get enough of it the hoover uh30010com platinum is quite simply the best vacuum period ie ever owned i absolutely love this machine and to get 2 vacuums an upright and a canister for the same price just makes terrific economic sense it has extraordinary power in a relatively quiet sleek lightweight package that doesn leave me feeling deaf sore and exhausted bravo hoover\n",

off to other topoftheline brands but always returned to hoover for their unsurpassed cleaning power and reliabilitythat does not however mean they were perfect the hoover windtunnel u6439 bagged upright that ive had for the last several years would suck up a buick unfortunately it also rivaled a buick in the weight category although its supposedly a selfpropelled model i felt like i had to go into training in order to vacuum my house it became something i would put off because i wasnt sure i had the strength to wrestle this bulky beast all over my house the windtunnel controls which allow you to change the brush height from carpet to floor were manual hardtomove levers on the brush housing which required you to shut the machine off in order to properly manipulate them the hepa filter on my old windtunnel seemed to work only for the first few months after that all manner of airborne particles would fly around as i vacuumed even after i cleanedreplaced the filters lastly noise of my previous windtunnel was something akin to a jet taking offwhen i saw a tv commercial for the hoover platinum series machines i was definitely intrigued i loved the idea of getting two separate vacuums together for one price brilliant marketing idea there hoover but i was skeptical could the power of a hoover truly be housed in something that weighs only 11 pounds id tried other lightweight vacuums in the past and their suction was dubious at besti made a beeline for the internet to start researching over a couple of days of intensive reading i decided to continue my trust in hoover and took the plungeboth machines come packaged together in a single tall box which was waiting for me on my front porch when i got home from work the first thing i noticed was that i could actually lift the entire box into the house without grunting like a sumo wrestler that was promising after removing everything i was stunned at the weight or lack thereof for both machinesthe physical appearance is very appealing the upright is sleek and slim with a 35 long cord and the canister has toolsonboard along with an ingenious shoulder strap so you can wear it while you vacuum you will be stunned by how little these machines weigh a child could easily lift them both but could they cleanwhen i fired up the platinum upright the word that kept coming out of my mouth was wow first off no more jets taking off in my living room just a pleasing hum second this impossibly lightweight wonder gives a whole new meaning to the term selfpropelled it seemingly floated over my carpeting all on its own while still having the suckupabuick power i expected from a hoover it cleaned better in one pass than its older u6439 windtunnel behemoth cousin did in several passes i was picking up stuff i didnt even know was there whether vacuuming underneath your bed or behind that dresser that you havent moved since you moved in 15 years ago it was astonishing how well this machine worked in just one passi have a rather large bulky throw rug in my kitchen that i had been preparing to replace because it had become so unvacuumable in recent weeks the platinum upright made it look brand new and hallelujah for a true edge cleaner everyone claims to have edge cleaning ability on their uprights but this one truly delivers on the promise think about those sneaky areas in your house where all sorts of stuff lingers like that dead zone along the baseboards tucked up under the bottom of your kitchen cabinets where they meet the kitchen floor this platinum upright sucked up all that debris right to the edgethe maneuverability of the platinum upright is astonishing it truly is as light as hoover claims and it moves as easily as a dyson the upright portion of the machine lowers completely parallel to the floor so it really can move under coffee tables with ease it also moves from carpeting to floors effortlessly with an intelligent lighted fingertip control right up there on the handlethe hepa filtration is lightyears ahead of my previous windtunnel think hepa with a hemi under the hood yes i know that bags are expensive but you can find discounts if you search online and buy in bulk i dont mind paying for a product that truly works these bags and this new platinum hepa filtration system truly work no dust or other airborne nasties were visible anywherethe platinum canister has a carrying strap which makes so much sense the folks who clean my office building uses strapon canister vacuums and i always what an intelligent design now ive got my own and all the tools are right there attached to the unit ready and waiting for you i toted that canister all over the house cleaning window sills ceiling corners air conditioning vents everything then i walked into the garage and cleaned the inside of my suv its quiet powerful and incredibly portable the best canister ive ever usedin my first test run of this hoover platinum vacuum system i found myself looking for stuff to clean i couldnt get enough of it the hoover uh30010com platinum is quite simply the best vacuum period ive ever owned i absolutely love this machine and to get 2 vacuums an upright and a canister for the same price just makes terrific economic sense it has extraordinary power in a relatively quiet sleek lightweight package that doesnt leave me feeling deaf sore and exhausted bravo hoover\n",

switching off to other topoftheline brands but i always return to hoover for their unsurpassed cleaning power and reliability that does not however mean they were perfect the hoover windtunnel u6439 bagged upright that ive had for the last several years would suck up a buick unfortunately it also rivaled a buick in the weight category although its supposedly a selfpropelled model i felt like i had to go into training in order to vacuum my house it became something i would put off because i wasnt sure i had the strength to wrestle this bulky beast all over my house the windtunnel controls which allow you to change the brush height from carpet to floor were manual hardtomove levers on the brush housing which required you to shut the machine off in order to properly manipulate them the hepa filter on my old windtunnel seemed to work only for the first few months after that all manner of airborne particles would fly around as i vacuumed even after i cleanedreplaced the filters lastly noise of my previous windtunnel was something akin to a jet taking offwhen i saw a tv commercial for the hoover platinum series machines i was definitely intrigued i loved the idea of getting two separate vacuums together for one price brilliant marketing idea there hoover but i was skeptical could the power of a hoover truly be housed in something that weighs only 11 pounds id tried other lightweight vacuums in the past and their suction was dubious at best i made a beeline for the internet to start researching over a couple of days of intensive reading yes im very thorough i decided to continue my trust in hoover and took the plunge both machines come packaged together in a single tall box which was waiting for me on my front porch when i got home from work the first thing i noticed was that i could actually lift the entire box into the house without grunting like a sumo wrestler that was promising after removing everything i was stunned at the weight or lack thereof for both machinesthe physical appearance is very appealing the upright is sleek and slim with a 35 long cord and the canister has toolsonboard along with an ingenious shoulder strap so you can wear it while you vacuum you will be stunned by how little these machines weigh a child could easily lift them both but could they cleanwhen i fired up the platinum upright the word that kept coming out of my mouth was wow first off no more jets taking off in my living room just a pleasing hum second this impossibly lightweight wonder gives a whole new meaning to the term selfpropelled it seemingly floated over my carpeting all on its own while still having the suckupabuick power i expected from a hoover it cleaned better in one pass than its older u6439 windtunnel behemoth cousin did in several passes i was picking up stuff i didnt even know was there how about making a pass underneath your bed or behind your dresser that you havent moved since you moved in 15 years ago it was astonishing how well this machine worked in just one passi have a rather large bulky throw rug in my kitchen that i had been preparing to replace because it had become so unvacuumable in recent weeks the platinum upright made it look brand new and hallelujah for a true edge cleaner everyone claims to have edge cleaning ability on their uprights but this one truly delivers on the promise think about those sneaky areas in your house where all sorts of stuff lingers like that dead zone along the baseboards tucked up under the bottom of your kitchen cabinets where they meet the kitchen floor this platinum upright sucked up all that debris immediately right to the edge the maneuverability of the platinum upright is astonishing it truly is as light as hoover claims and it moves as easily as a dyson the upright portion of the machine lowers completely parallel to the floor so it really can move under coffee tables with ease it also moves from carpeting to floors effortlessly with an intelligent lighted fingertip control right up there on the handle the hepa filtration is lightyears ahead of my previous windtunnel think hepa with a hemi under the hood yes i know that bags are expensive but you can find discounts if you search online and buy in bulk plus i dont mind paying for a product that truly works these bags and this new platinum hepa filtration system truly work no dust or other airborne nasties were visible anywherethe platinum canister has a carrying strap which makes so much sense the maintenance crew who cleans my office building uses strapon canister vacuums and i always thought that was such an intelligent design now ive got my own and all the tools are right there attached to the unit ready and waiting for you i toted that canister all over the house cleaning window sills ceiling corners air conditioning vents everything then i walked into the garage and started cleaning the inside of my suv its quiet powerful and incredibly portable the best canister ive ever usedin my first test run of this hoover platinum vacuum system i found myself looking for stuff to clean i couldnt get enough of it the hoover uh30010com platinum is quite simply the best vacuum period ive ever owned i absolutely love this machine and to get 2 vacuums an upright and a canister for the same price just makes terrific economic sense it has extraordinary power in a relatively quiet sleek
